  "intro": "Calculate the exact number of tiles needed for floors, walls, backsplashes, or showers. Accounts for tile size, grout spacing, waste factors (typically 10-15% for standard layouts, 15-20% for diagonal or herringbone patterns), and country-specific standards. Supports ceramic, porcelain, natural stone, and mosaic tiles in both metric and imperial units.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Measure Surface Area",
      "description": "For floors: measure length × width. For walls: measure height × width, subtract doors/windows. For backsplashes: measure length × height. Use the same unit system (meters or feet) throughout. Record measurements at widest points."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enter Tile Dimensions",
      "description": "Input tile length and width. Common sizes: 30×30cm (12×12in), 60×60cm (24×24in), 30×60cm (12×24in). For mosaic sheets, enter sheet dimensions. The calculator accounts for grout spacing automatically."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set Grout Spacing",
      "description": "Standard grout spacing is 2-3mm (1/16-1/8in) for small tiles and 3-5mm (1/8-3/16in) for large tiles. Wider spacing (5-10mm) is used for natural stone. This affects tile count and material needs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select Layout Pattern",
      "description": "Straight/offset layouts need 10-15% waste. Diagonal layouts need 15-20% waste. Herringbone or complex patterns need 20-25% waste. The calculator applies appropriate waste factors based on your selection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Calculate Tile Count",
      "description": "The calculator shows: total tiles needed, boxes/packs required (based on coverage per box), grout volume needed, and total cost estimate. Always round up to full boxes and add 5-10% extra for breakage and future repairs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Order Materials",
      "description": "Order all tiles from the same batch/lot for color consistency. Buy 10-15% extra for future repairs. Calculate grout separately: typically 1.5-2kg per m² for 3mm spacing, more for wider joints."
    }
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Not accounting for grout spacing",
      "solution": "Grout spacing reduces the number of tiles needed. A 3mm grout line on 30cm tiles means each tile effectively covers 30.3cm. The calculator accounts for this automatically, but verify your spacing matches the calculation."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Underestimating waste for diagonal layouts",
      "solution": "Diagonal and herringbone patterns create triangular offcuts that increase waste to 15-25% (vs 10-15% for straight layouts). Always add extra for pattern matching and cuts around obstacles."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting to subtract fixtures and obstacles",
      "solution": "Subtract areas for toilets, vanities, bathtubs, and other fixtures. For complex cuts around pipes or corners, add 5% extra waste. Measure fixture footprints accurately."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Not ordering extra from the same batch",
      "solution": "Tile colors vary between batches. Always order 10-15% extra from the same batch/lot number for future repairs. Store leftovers properly to prevent damage."
    }
  ],
  "proTips": [
    "Buy all tiles from the same batch/lot number. Color variations between batches can be noticeable, especially with natural stone or hand-painted tiles.",
    "For diagonal layouts, add 20% waste instead of 15%. The diagonal cuts create more triangular offcuts that can't be reused.",
    "Calculate grout separately based on joint width and depth. Standard: 1.5-2kg per m² for 3mm joints, 2.5-3.5kg for 5mm joints.",
    "For mosaic tiles, account for sheet size and pattern repeat. Some mosaics have directional patterns that affect layout and waste.",
    "Keep 10-15% extra tiles for future repairs. Manufacturers discontinue colors, and you'll need matching tiles for damage or expansion.",
    "For wet areas (showers, backsplashes), add waterproofing membrane to your material list. Calculate membrane area separately (typically same as tile area)."
  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much waste should I account for?",
      "answer": "Straight/offset layouts: 10-15% waste. Diagonal layouts: 15-20% waste. Herringbone or complex patterns: 20-25% waste. Always add 10-15% extra beyond calculated needs for future repairs and breakage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to calculate grout separately?",
      "answer": "Yes, grout is calculated separately. Standard grout usage: 1.5-2kg per m² for 3mm joints, 2.5-3.5kg for 5mm joints. Wider joints or deeper tiles require more grout. Always buy 10-20% extra."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I account for tile cuts around obstacles?",
      "answer": "For simple cuts (straight edges), the standard waste factor covers this. For complex cuts (pipes, corners, irregular shapes), add 5% extra waste. Measure obstacle footprints and subtract from total area."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about mosaic tiles?",
      "answer": "Mosaic tiles are sold in sheets. Calculate based on sheet dimensions and coverage. Account for pattern repeat if the mosaic has directional patterns. Standard waste: 15-20% for mosaics due to sheet cutting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I order extra tiles?",
      "answer": "Yes, always order 10-15% extra from the same batch/lot. Tile colors vary between batches, and you'll need matching tiles for future repairs, damage, or expansion. Manufacturers discontinue colors regularly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I calculate for multiple rooms?",
      "answer": "Calculate each room separately, then sum totals. This helps identify waste factors per room and ensures accurate accounting for different room sizes, layouts, and obstacle patterns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between ceramic and porcelain tile calculations?",
      "answer": "Calculation method is the same, but porcelain tiles are typically larger (60×60cm vs 30×30cm), which can reduce waste slightly. Both use the same waste factors based on layout pattern, not tile type."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need waterproofing membrane?",
      "answer": "For wet areas (showers, backsplashes, wet rooms), yes. Calculate membrane area separately (typically same as tile area). Membrane comes in rolls (typically 1m × 5-10m). Add 10% for overlaps and cuts."
