  "intro": "Calculate the exact amount of flooring material needed for your project, whether hardwood, laminate, vinyl, tile, or carpet. The calculator accounts for room dimensions, waste factors (typically 5-10% for rectangular rooms, 10-15% for irregular shapes), and standard material widths. Supports both metric and imperial units with automatic conversion.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Measure Room Dimensions",
      "description": "Measure the length and width of the room at the widest points. For irregular rooms, break them into rectangles and measure each section. Standard residential rooms are 3-5m (10-16ft) wide and 4-6m (13-20ft) long."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select Flooring Type",
      "description": "Choose your material: hardwood planks (typically 10-15cm wide), laminate (12-20cm), vinyl tiles (30-60cm), or carpet rolls (3-4m wide). Each type has different waste factors and installation patterns."
    },
    {
      "title": "Account for Waste Factor",
      "description": "Rectangular rooms need 5-10% waste for cuts and pattern matching. Irregular rooms, diagonal layouts, or herringbone patterns need 10-15% waste. The calculator applies country-specific defaults but you can adjust."
    },
    {
      "title": "Calculate Material Needed",
      "description": "The calculator shows total area, material needed including waste, and number of boxes/rolls required. For planks: divide by box coverage (typically 1.5-2.5 m² per box). Always round up to full boxes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Order Materials",
      "description": "Order 10-15% extra beyond calculated needs for future repairs and to ensure you have matching material from the same batch. Store leftovers in climate-controlled conditions."
    }

  "commonMistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Not measuring at widest points",
      "solution": "Always measure at the room's widest points, not just one corner. Rooms are rarely perfectly square, and measuring narrow points leads to material shortages."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Underestimating waste for irregular rooms",
      "solution": "Irregular shapes, diagonal layouts, and pattern matching (herringbone, chevron) require 10-15% waste, not the standard 5-10%. Always add extra for complex layouts."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting to account for closets and alcoves",
      "solution": "Include all areas: closets, alcoves, and under-stair spaces. These small areas add up and can account for 5-10% of total floor area."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Not ordering extra for future repairs",
      "solution": "Always order 10-15% extra beyond calculated needs. Flooring manufacturers discontinue colors/styles, and you'll need matching material for future repairs or expansions."
    }
  ],
  "proTips": [
    "Buy all flooring from the same batch/lot number to ensure color consistency. Mixing batches can show slight color variations.",
    "For diagonal or herringbone patterns, add 15-20% waste instead of the standard 10%. These patterns create more offcuts.",
    "Measure and order underlayment separately. Most flooring requires underlayment (foam, cork, or specialized), which has its own coverage calculations.",
    "For multi-room projects, calculate each room separately then sum totals. This helps identify which rooms need pattern matching.",
    "Keep leftover boxes in climate-controlled storage. Temperature and humidity changes can affect flooring dimensions and cause gaps or buckling.",
    "For hardwood, account for grain direction and board length. Longer boards reduce waste but may cost more. Plan your layout before ordering."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much waste should I account for?",
      "answer": "Rectangular rooms with straight layouts need 5-10% waste. Irregular rooms, diagonal patterns, or herringbone layouts need 10-15% waste. Always add 10-15% extra for future repairs and to ensure batch matching."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to calculate underlayment separately?",
      "answer": "Yes, underlayment (foam, cork, or specialized) is calculated separately. Most underlayment comes in rolls (typically 1m × 10-15m) or sheets. Calculate based on total floor area plus 5% for overlaps and cuts."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I calculate for multiple rooms?",
      "answer": "Calculate each room separately, then sum the totals. This helps identify waste factors per room and ensures you account for different room shapes and sizes accurately."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about closets and small spaces?",
      "answer": "Include all areas: closets, alcoves, under-stair spaces, and any nooks. These small areas can add 5-10% to total floor area. Measure them accurately and include in your calculation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I order extra for future repairs?",
      "answer": "Yes, always order 10-15% extra. Flooring manufacturers discontinue colors and styles, and you'll need matching material for future repairs, expansions, or damage. Store leftovers properly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I account for pattern matching?",
      "answer": "Pattern matching (herringbone, chevron, or directional patterns) requires 15-20% waste instead of standard 10%. Plan your layout before ordering to minimize waste while maintaining pattern consistency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my room is irregularly shaped?",
      "answer": "Break irregular rooms into rectangles, calculate each section separately, then sum the totals. Add 10-15% waste for irregular shapes (instead of 5-10% for rectangular rooms)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need different calculations for different flooring types?",
      "answer": "Yes, each type has different considerations: hardwood (grain direction, board length), laminate (box coverage, click-lock patterns), vinyl (tile size, sheet width), carpet (roll width, pattern repeat). Use the calculator's specific settings for each type."
