  "intro": "Accurately calculate the volume of concrete needed for slabs, foundations, columns, and other structural elements. This calculator accounts for standard waste factors (typically 5-10%) required by building codes to cover pumping losses, spillage, and finishing cuts. Supports both metric (m³) and imperial (yd³) units with automatic conversion.",

    {
      "title": "Select Shape Type",
      "description": "Choose between 'Slab' for rectangular foundations and floors, or 'Cylinder' for columns and round footings. Slabs require length, width, and thickness. Cylinders need diameter and height."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enter Dimensions",
      "description": "Input measurements in your preferred unit system. For slabs: length (typically 4-12m or 12-40ft), width (3-8m or 10-26ft), and thickness (0.1-0.3m or 4-12in). For cylinders: diameter (0.2-2m or 8in-6ft) and height (0.5-6m or 2-20ft)."

    {
      "title": "Review Waste Factor",
      "description": "The calculator applies a country-specific waste factor (usually 5-10%) based on local building standards. This covers concrete lost during pumping, spillage, and cutting. You can adjust this if your project has specific requirements."
    },
    {
      "title": "Calculate Volume",
      "description": "Click calculate to see the total concrete volume needed. The result shows both the base volume and the volume including waste. For slabs: Volume = Length × Width × Thickness. For cylinders: Volume = π × (Diameter/2)² × Height."

      "title": "Order Ready-Mix",
      "description": "Use the calculated volume to order ready-mix concrete from your supplier. Standard truck loads are typically 6-10 m³ (8-13 yd³). Round up to the nearest truck load to avoid shortfalls."

  "commonMistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting to account for waste factor",
      "solution": "Always include the 5-10% waste factor. Running short means delays, extra delivery costs, and potential cold joints if you can't pour continuously."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Measuring dimensions incorrectly",
      "solution": "Measure the actual formwork dimensions, not the finished floor area. Add 2-5cm (1-2in) extra if you're pouring over existing surfaces that need leveling."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Not considering reinforcement displacement",
      "solution": "Rebar volume is negligible (typically <1% of total), so it's not deducted. However, for heavily reinforced sections (>3% steel), you might add 2-3% extra volume."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Ignoring unit system consistency",
      "solution": "Ensure all dimensions use the same unit system. Mixing meters with feet will give incorrect results. The calculator handles conversion automatically if you switch units mid-calculation."
    }
  ],
  "proTips": [
    "Order 10-15% extra for small projects (<5 m³) to account for formwork irregularities and finishing needs.",
    "For exposed aggregate or decorative finishes, add 5% extra volume to ensure you have enough material for the top layer.",
    "Coordinate with your ready-mix supplier to schedule deliveries in 2-3 hour intervals to avoid cold joints.",
    "Use the cylinder mode for round columns, but remember that most columns have square bases—use slab mode for those.",
    "For sloped surfaces, calculate the average thickness: (min thickness + max thickness) / 2.",
    "Keep a small reserve (1-2 m³) on-site for patching and touch-ups after formwork removal."
  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Does the volume include reinforcement?",
      "answer": "No, rebar volume is not deducted because steel displacement is negligible at typical reinforcement ratios (usually <1% of total volume). For heavily reinforced sections (>3% steel by volume), you may want to add 2-3% extra concrete."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is there a waste factor?",
      "answer": "Building codes in most countries require a minimum overage (typically 5-10%) to cover pumping losses, spillage during transport, and finishing cuts. This prevents shortfalls that cause delays and additional delivery costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I convert between m³ and yd³?",
      "answer": "1 cubic meter (m³) = 1.308 cubic yards (yd³). The calculator handles this conversion automatically. For reference: 1 m³ ≈ 1.31 yd³, so multiply m³ by 1.31 to get yd³."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my slab has openings or cutouts?",
      "answer": "Calculate the main slab volume first, then subtract the volume of openings (length × width × thickness). For irregular shapes, break them into rectangles and calculate each separately."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much concrete does a standard truck carry?",
      "answer": "Ready-mix trucks typically carry 6-10 m³ (8-13 yd³) per load. Smaller trucks (4-6 m³) are available for tight access sites. Always confirm capacity with your supplier before ordering."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I order extra for small batches?",
      "answer": "Yes, for projects under 5 m³, order 10-15% extra because small batches have proportionally higher waste from formwork cleanup and finishing. For larger projects (>20 m³), the standard 5-10% waste factor is usually sufficient."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for post-tensioned slabs?",
      "answer": "Yes, but post-tensioned slabs often have varying thickness. Calculate each thickness zone separately and sum the volumes. Also account for the volume occupied by ducts (typically add 2-3% extra)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about sloped or tapered surfaces?",
      "answer": "For sloped surfaces, use the average thickness: (minimum thickness + maximum thickness) / 2. For complex tapers, break the area into zones with uniform thickness and calculate each zone separately."
