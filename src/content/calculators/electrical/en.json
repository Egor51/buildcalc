  "intro": "Estimate electrical materials needed for residential or commercial wiring projects. Accounts for room dimensions, number of circuits, outlet and switch requirements, wire gauge, conduit needs, and country-specific electrical codes. This calculator provides material estimates for planning purposes. Always consult a licensed electrician for actual installation.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Measure Room Dimensions",
      "description": "Measure room length, width, and height. For multiple rooms, measure each separately. Standard residential rooms are 3-5m (10-16ft) wide, 4-6m (13-20ft) long, and 2.4-2.7m (8-9ft) high. Record all measurements consistently."
    },
    {
      "title": "Determine Circuit Requirements",
      "description": "Standard residential: 1 circuit per 20 m² (215 ft²) for general lighting/outlets. Kitchens and bathrooms typically need dedicated circuits. Count number of circuits needed based on room size and usage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Calculate Outlet and Switch Count",
      "description": "Building codes specify minimum outlets: typically 1 outlet per 3-4m (10-12ft) of wall. Count outlets and switches needed. Standard room: 4-8 outlets, 2-4 switches. Kitchens and bathrooms need more."
    },
    {
      "title": "Estimate Wire Length",
      "description": "Wire length depends on circuit routing, outlet locations, and panel distance. Rough estimate: 1.5-2× room perimeter for basic circuits. Add 20-30% for complex routing, multiple floors, or long panel distances."
    },
    {
      "title": "Account for Waste Factor",
      "description": "Electrical work typically needs 10-15% waste for cuts, routing variations, and code compliance adjustments. Complex layouts or multi-story buildings may need 15-20% waste."
    },
    {
      "title": "Calculate Materials",
      "description": "The calculator estimates: wire length (by gauge), number of outlets/switches, junction boxes, conduit (if required), and circuit breakers. Always round up to standard package sizes. Order 10-15% extra for future repairs."
    }

  "commonMistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Not accounting for local electrical codes",
      "solution": "Electrical codes vary by country and region. Minimum outlet spacing, wire gauge requirements, and circuit capacity differ. Always verify local codes before calculating. This calculator provides estimates only—consult a licensed electrician."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Underestimating wire length",
      "solution": "Wire routing is rarely straight. Account for vertical runs (to ceiling/attic), horizontal runs (around obstacles), and code-required routing paths. Add 20-30% to straight-line estimates for realistic totals."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting junction boxes and conduit",
      "solution": "Junction boxes are required at every connection point. Conduit may be required by code in some regions or for exposed wiring. Calculate these separately based on routing and code requirements."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Not ordering extra for future repairs",
      "solution": "Always order 10-15% extra wire and materials. Electrical work often needs adjustments during installation, and you'll need matching materials for future repairs or expansions."

  "proTips": [
    "Always consult a licensed electrician for actual installation. This calculator provides planning estimates only. Electrical work must comply with local codes and safety standards.",
    "Verify local electrical codes before calculating. Minimum outlet spacing, wire gauge requirements, and circuit capacity vary by country and region.",
    "Plan circuit routing before calculating. Straight runs use less wire than complex routing around obstacles. Consider vertical runs (to ceiling/attic) and horizontal runs separately.",
    "Calculate junction boxes separately: typically 1 per outlet/switch, plus additional boxes for splices and code-required access points.",
    "For conduit, calculate based on routing length plus 10% for fittings and bends. Conduit size depends on wire gauge and number of conductors.",
    "Keep 10-15% extra materials for future repairs and code compliance adjustments. Store in a dry location to prevent damage."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much waste should I account for?",
      "answer": "Standard electrical work: 10-15% waste. Complex layouts or multi-story buildings: 15-20% waste. Always add 10-15% extra beyond calculated needs for future repairs and code compliance adjustments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to follow local electrical codes?",
      "answer": "Yes, electrical work must comply with local codes. Codes specify minimum outlet spacing, wire gauge requirements, circuit capacity, and safety standards. This calculator provides estimates only—always consult a licensed electrician for actual installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I calculate wire length?",
      "answer": "Wire length depends on circuit routing, outlet locations, and panel distance. Rough estimate: 1.5-2× room perimeter for basic circuits. Add 20-30% for complex routing, multiple floors, or long panel distances. Account for vertical and horizontal runs separately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I order extra materials?",
      "answer": "Yes, order 10-15% extra wire and materials. Electrical work often needs adjustments during installation, and you'll need matching materials for future repairs, expansions, or code compliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about junction boxes and conduit?",
      "answer": "Junction boxes: typically 1 per outlet/switch, plus additional for splices. Conduit: calculate based on routing length plus 10% for fittings. Conduit may be required by code in some regions. Verify local requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I account for different wire gauges?",
      "answer": "Wire gauge depends on circuit capacity and code requirements. Standard residential: 14 AWG (1.5mm²) for 15A circuits, 12 AWG (2.5mm²) for 20A circuits. Calculate each gauge separately based on circuit requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I calculate for multiple rooms?",
      "answer": "Calculate each room separately, then sum totals. This helps identify circuit requirements per room and ensures accurate accounting for different room sizes, usage patterns, and code requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for commercial projects?",
      "answer": "This calculator provides basic estimates. Commercial projects have different requirements (higher capacity circuits, three-phase power, specialized equipment). Always consult a licensed electrician and electrical engineer for commercial work."
