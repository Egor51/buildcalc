# Complete Guide to Tile Calculator

This guide will help you accurately calculate tile quantities for walls, floors, and other surfaces, including support for diagonal layouts.

## Measuring Surface Area

Measure the length and width of the surface to be tiled:

- **Walls**: Measure height and width
- **Floors**: Measure length and width
- **Irregular surfaces**: Break into rectangles and calculate each separately

## Understanding Tile Sizes

Common tile sizes:
- Small tiles: 10×10cm to 20×20cm
- Medium tiles: 30×30cm to 40×40cm
- Large tiles: 60×60cm and above

Always verify actual tile dimensions from your supplier.

## Waste Factors

Waste factors account for:
- Cuts and trimming
- Pattern matching
- Breakage during installation

**Standard waste:**
- Straight layout: 5-10%
- Diagonal layout: 10-15%
- Complex patterns: 15-20%

## Diagonal Layouts

Diagonal layouts require more waste due to:
- Increased cutting at edges
- Pattern alignment challenges
- More complex installation

The calculator automatically increases waste factor for diagonal layouts.

## Best Practices

1. Always measure actual tile dimensions
2. Account for grout lines in calculations
3. Order 10-15% extra for repairs
4. Keep tiles from same batch for color consistency

## Common Mistakes

- Not accounting for diagonal layout waste
- Using wrong tile dimensions
- Forgetting grout space
- Not ordering extra for repairs

## Conclusion

Accurate tile calculations prevent shortages and reduce waste. Always verify measurements and tile dimensions before ordering.
