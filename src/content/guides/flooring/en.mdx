# Complete Guide to Flooring Calculator

This guide will help you accurately calculate flooring material requirements for any room, whether you're installing hardwood, laminate, vinyl, or carpet.

## Measuring Room Dimensions

Always measure at the room's widest points, not just one corner. Rooms are rarely perfectly square:

- **Length**: Measure the longest wall
- **Width**: Measure the widest point perpendicular to length
- For irregular rooms, break them into rectangles and measure each section

## Understanding Waste Factors

Waste factors account for:
- Cuts and pattern matching
- Irregular room shapes
- Installation patterns (diagonal, herringbone)

**Standard waste factors:**
- Rectangular rooms: 5-10%
- Irregular rooms: 10-15%
- Diagonal/herringbone patterns: 10-15%

## Material Types and Coverage

Different materials have different pack sizes:

- **Hardwood planks**: Typically 1.5-2.5 m² per box
- **Laminate**: Usually 1.8-2.7 m² per box
- **Vinyl tiles**: 0.9-1.8 m² per box
- **Carpet rolls**: 3-4m wide, sold by linear meter

Always check the specific product packaging for exact coverage.

## Best Practices

1. Measure at widest points to avoid shortages
2. Order 10-15% extra for future repairs
3. Store leftovers in climate-controlled conditions
4. Keep material from same batch for consistency

## Common Mistakes

- Not measuring at widest points
- Forgetting waste factor for irregular shapes
- Not ordering extra for repairs
- Mixing different batches

## Conclusion

Accurate measurements and proper waste factors ensure you have enough material without excessive waste. Always verify measurements on-site before ordering.
